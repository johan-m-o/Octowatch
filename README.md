# Octowatch
An Octonauts Octowatch for the Bangle.js 1 (also works for the Bangle.js 2, but won't look quite as nice due to the low-bit display).

Works as a clock and displays the Octonauts logo on the watch. The idea is to have only this app, bootloader and the settings app installed on the watch, as a toy for a child.

Tapping the display will activate the Octo Alert that will run for 30 seconds or until the display is touched again. Pressing button 3 (or button 1 on the Bangle.js 2) will start a "phone call" and a random Octonauts character will show on the display. Clicking the call button again will "end" the call.

Clicking button 1 three times in quick succession will start the settings app. This is so that the child won't accidentally exit the Octowatch app.
